## Maven for Beginners

- Do magick.
- Put the stuff in the right stuff.
- Use `mvn clean install` to make majick happen.
- Use `mvn clean` to clean up after you get way too excited because it finally worked and now you're embarassed.
- Don't try to run the application in VSCode after cleaning up after yourself, because now you have to pull it all out from under your bed to start again.
