# Cybersecurity Concerns & Actions
- Our project implements a hashing algorithm with a randomly generated salt tied to each user for the storage of passwords.
  - We do NOT store passwords themselves in plain text!
- What we can improve on in the future:
  - Better secure where the information per user is stored - it currently is stored in a json file with pretty easy access.
